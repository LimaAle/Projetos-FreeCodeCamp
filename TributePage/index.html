      <p>Leslie William Nielsen, OC (11 February 1926 – 28 November 2010) was a Canadian American actor, comedian, and producer. He appeared in more than 100 films and 150 television programs, portraying more than 220 characters.</p>
      <p>Nielsen was born on 11 February 1926 in Regina, Saskatchewan. His mother, Mabel Elizabeth (née Davies), was a Welsh immigrant, and his father, Ingvard Eversen Nielsen, was a Danish-born constable in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Nielsen had
        two brothers; the elder, Erik Nielsen (1924–2008), was Deputy Prime Minister of Canada from 1984 to 1986.

      <p>Nielsen's career began in dramatic roles on television during "Television's Golden Age", appearing in almost 50 live programs in 1950 alone. He said there "was very little gold, we only got $75 or $100 per show." He narrated documentaries and commercials
        and most of his early work as a dramatic actor was uneventful.</p>
      <p>Nielsen's supporting role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's 1980's Airplane! was a watershed in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as Zero Hour! and Airport, was based on building a comedy around the actors known
        for dramatic roles. Other stars included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him. When asked, "Surely you can't be serious?", he responded with a curt, "I am serious.
        And don't call me Shirley." In several interviews he reflected on the line: "I thought it was amusing, but it never occurred to me that it was going to become a trademark.</p>
      <p>In November 2010, Nielsen was admitted to a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, hospital with pneumonia. On 28 November, Doug Nielsen, Nielsen's nephew, told the CJOB radio station that 84-year-old Nielsen had died in his sleep from pneumonia around 5:30
        pm EST surrounded by family and friends. He was interred in Fort Lauderdale's Evergreen Cemetery. As a final bit of humor, Nielsen chose "Let 'er rip" as his epitaph.</p>
